# VoiceSocialNetwork
Graduation Project

Overview

Summary

Social media for blind is a web application designed to help people with Impaired Visuals[1], specifically the blind ones to interact and communicate with each other around the world through voice by using softwares like Speech Recognition[2]. The idea behind this is to make it possible for people with impaired visuals to keep track with their friends and families, even if they're blind, by allowing the site to read all the texts, posts and to even be able to identify what's in the pictures, ultimately acting as their eyes.

Objectives

Not to make the means of social communication limited to those who can read only.
The interaction of these disabled people with the society as a whole without feeling deficient.
Much easier and a faster way to communicate due to it’s Speech Recognition feature.
People with Impaired Visuals will be able to interact and communicate normally.
Will not only be constrained to Impaired Visuals, it can be used by everyone.
Making the technology available to serve those with disabilities.

Chapter 1: Introduction

Social Media[3]

Social media are apps that enable people from different places and countries to be in touch and interact, like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat and others.
But if we use the term to describe a site like Facebook or Instagram, which are a bit different from each other, then it starts to get more confusing. Just what is social media anyway?
The term is used so vaguely that it can basically be used to describe almost any website on the internet today. Or maybe not. Some people have more of a restricted view of social media, often equating it to mean the same as social networking (a.k.a. Facebook, Twitter, etc.). Other people don't consider blogs to fall under the social media category.
Rather than defining the term using a bunch of boring jargon that would probably only complicate things further, perhaps the best way to get a clearer understanding of it is to break it down into simpler terms. To start, let's look at each word individually.
The "social" part: refers to interacting with other people by sharing information with them and receiving information from them.
The "media" part: refers to an instrument of communication, like the internet (while TV, radio, and newspapers are examples of more traditional forms of media).

The First Idea of Communication and Interaction[4]

Electronic mail (email) is a method of exchanging messages ("Mail") between people using electronic devices. Invented by Ray Tomlinson, email first entered limited use in the 1960s and by the mid-1970s had taken the form now recognized as email. 
Email operates across Computer Networks, which today is primarily the Internet. Some early email systems required the author and the recipient to both be Online at the same time, in common with Instant Messaging. Today's email systems are based on a Store-and-Forward model. Email Servers accept, forward, deliver, and store messages. Neither the users nor their computers are required to be online simultaneously, they need to connect only briefly, typically to a Mail Server or a Webmail interface, for as long as it takes to send or receive messages.

Originally an ASCII text-only communications medium, Internet email was extended by Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) to carry text in other character sets and multimedia content
attachments. International Email, with internationalized email addresses using UTF-8, has been standardized, but as of 2017 it has not been widely adopted.
The history of modern Internet email services reaches back to the early ARPANET, with standards for encoding email messages published as early as 1973 (RFC 561). An email message sent in the early 1970s looks very similar to a basic email sent today. Email had an important role in creating the Internet, and the conversion from ARPANET to the Internet in the early 1980s produced the core of the current services.

Common Social Media Features[5]

The following list of common features are dead giveaways of a social media site. If you're questioning whether a particular site could be classified as social or not, try looking for at least one of these features.
User accounts
If a site allows visitors to create their own accounts that they can log into, then it will let them social interact with the community. You can't really share information or interact with others online without doing it through a user account.

Profile pages

Since social media is all about communication, a profile page is often necessary to represent an individual. It often includes information about the individual user, like a profile photo, bio, website, feed of recent posts, recommendations, recent activity and more.
Friends, followers, groups, hashtags and so on
Individuals use their accounts to connect with other users. They can also use them to subscribe to certain forms of information.

News feeds

When users connect with other users on social media, they're basically saying, "I want to get information from these people." That information is updated for them in real-time via their news feed.

Personalization

Social media sites usually give users the flexibility to configure their user settings, customize their profiles to look a specific way, organize their friends or followers, manage the information they see in their news feeds and even give feedback on what they do or don't want to see.

Notifications

Any site or app that notifies users about specific information is definitely playing the social media game. Users have total control over these notifications and can choose to receive the types of notifications that they want.

Information updating, saving or posting

If a site or an app allows you to post absolutely anything, with or without a user account, then it's social! It could be a simple text-based message, a photo upload, a YouTube video, a link to an article or anything else.

Like buttons and comment sections

Two of the most common ways we interact on social media are via buttons that represent a "like" plus comment sections where we can share our thoughts.

Review, rating or voting systems

Besides liking and commenting, lots of social media sites and apps rely on the collective effort of the community to review, rate and vote on information that they know about or have used. Think of your favorite shopping sites or movie review sites that use this social media feature.

Problem that our application solves

People who are visually impaired or blind can’t use social networks the way everyone else does. Those people could be our friends or relatives. They also want to be able to communicate the same way we do and have their own personal page that expresses their opinions and present their ideas, so we want to help them through a program that supports a service which provides them with what they need to do so. 
This service provides the ability to login and register using your voice, as well as recording and listening to comments or posts and communicate with everyone due to its voice oriented nature. Everyone will be able to interact with everyone, doesn't matter if you're visually impaired or not. They’ll have full control over the service through voice commands, whether it’s to communicate with someone or sharing their opinions.

Related Work

The services and technologies that we will use are Artificial Intelligence[6] and  Speech Recognition.
Here we will represent some of the related works that looks like our web site application

Amazon Alexa[7]

known simply as Alexa, is a Virtual Assistant developed by Amazon, first used in the Amazon Echo and the Amazon Echo Dot Smart Speakers developed by Amazon Lab126. It is capable of voice interaction, music playback, making to-do lists, Setting Alarms, streaming podcasts, playing audiobooks, and providing weather, traffic, sports, and other real-time information, such as News. Alexa can also control several Smart Devices using itself as a Home Automation system. Users are able to extend the Alexa capabilities by installing "skills" (additional functionality developed by third-party vendors, in other settings more commonly called Apps such as weather programs and audio features).
Most devices with Alexa allow users to activate the device using a wake-word (such as Alexa); other devices (such as the Amazon Mobile App on iOS or Android) require the user to push a button to activate Alexa's listening mode. Currently, interaction and communication with Alexa are available only in English, German, French, Italian, Spanish, and Japanese. In Canada, Alexa is available in English and in French (with the Québec accent).
 
Disadvantages

Arabic language is weak.
Serve only the company work and users

Dragon Professional[8]

Dragon Professional is a sophisticated voice recognition software that provides a high level of accuracy. Like other voice recognition software, it becomes increasingly accurate as it becomes familiar with your voice, your accent and your way of speaking. But this software doesn’t need extensive training to familiarize itself with your voice and speech patterns, as is sometimes the case with other software packages. Once you have all of your preferences and settings in place, this software achieves impressive accuracy out of the box. You can record your voice or someone else’s and have it transcribed by your computer. You can customize the software to open, close and operate programs like Word and Excel on command. It has an impressive feature package and functionality, and it is also legally certified as a tool for professionals with disabilities. 
Dictating speech to text is the main function of this software. This voice-to-text software scored high on accuracy, reaching 95 percent. This is partly due to the software's advanced vocabulary Profession

Disadvantages

Not supported arabic language
Has no artificial intelligence assistant

Siri[9]

Siri is a virtual assistant that is part of Apple Inc.'s iOS, watch OS, macOS, and tv OS operating systems. The assistant uses voice queries and a natural-language user interface to answer questions, make recommendations, and perform actions by delegating requests to a set of Internet services. The software adapts to users' individual language usages, searches, and preferences, with continuing use. Returned results are individualized.
Siri is a spin-off from a project originally developed by SRI International Artificial Intelligence Center. Its speech recognition engine was provided by Nuance Communications, and Siri uses advanced machine learning technologies to function. Its original American, British, and Australian voice actors recorded their respective voices around 2005, unaware of the recordings' eventual usage in Siri. The voice assistant was released as an app for iOS in February 2010, and it was acquired by Apple two months later. Siri was then integrated into the iPhone 4S at its release in October 2011. At that time, the separate app was also removed from the iOS App Store. Siri has since become an integral part of Apple's products, having been adapted into other hardware devices over the years, including newer iPhone models, as well as iPad, iPod Touch, Mac, Air Pods, Apple TV, and Home Pod.
Siri supports a wide range of user commands, including performing phone actions, checking basic information, scheduling events and reminders, handling device settings, searching the Internet, navigating areas, finding information on entertainment, and is able to engage with iOS-integrated apps. With the release of iOS 10 in 2016, Apple opened up limited third-party access to Siri, including third-party messaging apps, as well as payments, ride-sharing, and Internet calling apps. With the release of iOS 11, Apple updated Siri's voices for more clear, human voices, started supporting follow-up questions and language translation, and additional third-party actions.

Tools[10]

HTML(Hyper Text Markable Language)

CSS(Cascading Style Sheets)

Javascript

Node.js

HTML

HTML is a language for describing the structure of Web pages. HTML gives authors the means to:
Publish online documents with headings, text, tables, lists, photos, etc.
Retrieve online information via hypertext links, at the click of a button.
Design forms for conducting transactions with remote services, for use in searching for information, making reservations, ordering products, etc.
Include spreadsheet, video clips, sound clips, and other applications directly in their documents.
With HTML, the authors describe the structure of pages using markup. The elements of the language label pieces of content such as “paragraph,” “list,” “table,” and so on.

CSS

CSS is a language for describing the presentation of Web pages, including colors, layout, and fonts. It allows one to adapt the presentation to different types of devices, such as large screens, small screens, or printers. CSS is independent of HTML and can be used with any XML-based markup language. The separation of HTML from CSS makes it easier to maintain sites, share style sheets across pages, and tailor pages to different environments. This is referred to as the separation of structure (or: content) from presentation.

Javascript

A script is program code that doesn’t need pre-processing (e.g. compiling) before being run. In the context of a Web browser, scripting usually refers to program code written in JavaScript that is executed by the browser when a page is downloaded, or in response to an event triggered by the user.
Scripting can make Web pages more dynamic. For example, without reloading a new version of a page it may allow modifications to the content of that page, or allow content to be added to or sent from that page. The former has been called DHTML (Dynamic HTML), and the latter AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML).
Beyond this, scripts increasingly allow developers to create a bridge between the browser and the platform it is running on, making it possible, for example, to create Web pages that incorporate information from the user’s environment, such as current location, address book details, etc.
This additional interactivity makes Web pages behave like a traditional software application. These Web pages are often called Web applications and can be made available either directly in the browser as a Web page, or can be packaged and distributed as Widgets.

Node.js

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scripting—running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm unifying web application development around a single programming language, rather than different languages for server- and client-side scripts.
Though .js is the standard filename extension for JavaScript code, the name "Node.js" does not refer to a particular file in this context and is merely the name of the product. Node.js has an event-driven architecture capable of asynchronous I/O. These design choices aim to optimize throughput and scalability in web applications with many input/output operations, as well as for real-time Web applications (e.g., real-time communication programs and browser games)
